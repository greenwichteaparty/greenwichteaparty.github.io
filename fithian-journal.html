<p style="width: 400px; margin-left: 25%;">
    Last night the Tea was, by a number of persons in disguise, taken out of the House & consumed with fire.
    Violent, & different are words about this uncommon Manoeuvre among the inhabitants - Some rave, some curse &
    condemn, some try to reason; many are glad the Tea is destroyed, but almost all disapprove the Manner of the destruction.
